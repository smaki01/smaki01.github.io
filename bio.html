	<h2> Who am I? </h2>
<p>
I am currently a junior at Tufts University. I am interested in the intersection between the law and social justice, specifically in promoting health equity. I am a strong advocate for reproductive justice and reproductive justice. In the future, I hope to pursue a career that uses the law to advocate for people in disadvanted positions.
